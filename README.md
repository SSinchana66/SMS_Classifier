## Introduction
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build a classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and ham SMS messages. It serves as a demonstration of how data science can be applied to real-world problems, such as text classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains over 5,000 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository: git clone https://github.com/SSinchana66/SMS_Classifier.git
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   pip install jupyter numpy scikit-learn
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can open the project in Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

    
## Usage
After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebook SMS Classifier.ipynb to see the code implementation and results. The notebook guides you through the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The trained classifier achieved an accuracy of 96.68% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham messages.
