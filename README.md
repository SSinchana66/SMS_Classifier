## Introduction
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build a classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and ham SMS messages. It serves as a demonstration of how data science can be applied to real-world problems, such as text classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains over 5,000 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-classifier.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd sms-classifier
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebook SMS_Classifier.ipynb to see the code implementation and results. The notebook guides you through the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The trained classifier achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham messages.
